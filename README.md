# Pyramid-Solitaire-Game
The Solitaire Pyramid Game is a C++ based implementation of the classic single-player 
card game. In this game, the objective is to clear a pyramid of cards by pairing them to 
sum up to 13 points, with Kings being removed singly as they are worth 13 points. The 
game begins by shuffling a deck of cards and arranging 28 of them into a pyramid 
structure. Players can select pairs of exposed cards or draw from a stockpile to create 
valid pairs. The game includes features such as stock rotation and checks for win 
conditions to provide an engaging and strategic experience. This project demonstrates 
key concepts in data structures, algorithms, and highlighting the practical application of programming skills.
